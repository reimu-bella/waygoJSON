The elves held greater numbers, size, and physical strength, but the faeries' powerful magic frustrated and confused the efforts of their would-be conquerors to a standstill. \n\nA pact was formed, leaving the faeries their sovereignty and seclusion in exchange for a mutual protection of the Great Forest and the sanctuaries of innocence within.
